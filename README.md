life_java
=========

Conway's Life, implemented in Java 1.7 and JavaFX 2.2.  Requires Maven 3.

CHANGELOG
=========
27 November 2013 - RC1 - A total rewrite, over 95% new code.  Mostly JavaFX compliant, although I'm having difficulties
using the FXML loader, and so all of the MVC code is dumped into LifeApp.
